<i>If you have zero experience of software development and want to get some then following this article will be your <b>STEP-1</b></i>
- **Git** = A piece of code that you've to download which keep track of every single change you do in a folder.
- **GitHub** = A cloud platform connected to everyone else's computer by internet. Organizations store their lines of code on GitHub. <br> 
  - It enables individuals to interact/exchange stuff with the main codebase. 
  - You create an account on GitHub. Now you can create a <b><u>copy of any organization's code into your account</b></u>*, this process is called **"forking"**.
<hr>
To begin, you first need to have certain things in your computer:

- Git([official website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)):
  - <u>For macOS:</u><br>
  Make sure you have "homebrew" downloaded(if not then follow the instructions written [here](https://brew.sh/))<br>
  Then run this in your "terminal":<br>`brew install git`
  - <u>For Windows:</u><br>
  You have to download the file from the internet for which instructions are available [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- Integrated Deverlopment Environment(IDE):
  - Download and install Visual Studio Code in your system.

# Think of everything as features.
**A project is nothing but a bunch of features.**
- Different people code different features.
- You'll most probably make a feature in the software that doesn't exist yet.
- So what did we learn here? 
  - There's a main codebase, on GitHub, which 
  - There's a fork of that codebase
